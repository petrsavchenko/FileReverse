# File Reverse

Simple .net core app written using Test-Driven Development approach (TDD), it does:

1. Read an input text file.

2. Reverse the contents. Reverse means:

	* The first character of the first line of the output should be the last character of the last line of the input.
	
	* The first character of the second line of the output should be the last character of the second-last line of the input.

	* The last character of the last line of the output should be the first character of the first line of the input.

3. Write the reversed contents to an output file
